# Who's That Pokemon?
To further my familiarity with API's I created an app that tracks every countries COVID-19 statistics. I believe it is important to have some kind of raw number information to try to understand the severity of this pandemic. All information is from the https://covid-19.dataflowkit.com/ API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

All the statistics are pulled from the https://covid-19.dataflowkit.com/ API. Site is style with Bootstrap.


## Lessons Learned:

I got to work with and familiarize myself with the Bootstrap framework. I really helps give this site a sleek touch. The stats pulled from the API werent all there. Several countries either had empty strings, undifined, or "n/a". I had to refine my knowledge with looping through arrays/ objects to modify the values.
